desc: Here we first create a blog post and place the <code>meta</code> tag at the top where we add some properties to the post, like a post title, created date and author. We then fill out the rest of the post like a normal HTML page. Later in the <code>index.html</code> page we create a list of posts by using the <code>each</code> tag. Within that block we can refer to the properties that we created in the <code>meta</code> block of each file.
