The `messages` tag writes out any messages that were generated during the last form submission. For example, messages my generate some HTML like this:

    <div class="backlift-messages alert alert-info">
    	<span>not authorized<span>
    </div> 

For more information about working with forms in backlift see the [form??](), [formsuccess??](), and [formerrors??]() tags and the [guide to working with forms??]().
