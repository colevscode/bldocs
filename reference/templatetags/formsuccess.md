The `formsuccess` tag writes out an HTML notice if the previoius form submission was successful. For example, formsuccess may generate some HTML like this:

    <div class="backlift-form-success alert alert-success">
    	<span>success</span>
    </div> 

For more information about working with forms in backlift see the [form??](), [formerrors??](), and [messages??]() tags and the [guide to working with forms??]().
